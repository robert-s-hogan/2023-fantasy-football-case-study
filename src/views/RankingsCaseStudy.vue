      This case study compares the preseason draft rankings with the
      end-of-season (EOS) results. The data highlights the top performers,
      biggest risers, and the players who underperformed their preseason
      expectations.

        Data Overview and Explanation of Metrics
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The rankings used in this case study are sourced from
        <strong>Yahoo Fantasy Football</strong>. The preseason rankings reflect
        player draft order, expectations based on player form, team situation,
        and expert analysis.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        The end-of-season (EOS) rankings represent player performance based on
        total points scored and positional rankings at the end of the 2023
        season.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">Key Metrics</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Rank Difference:</strong> The difference between a playerâ€™s
          preseason draft ranking and their EOS ranking. A positive number means
          a player exceeded expectations, while a negative number means they
          underperformed.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Games Played:</strong> The total number of games a player
          participated in during the 2023 season, which contextualizes
          performance (e.g., missing games due to injuries or suspension).
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Points Per Game (PPG):</strong> A key metric to standardize
          player performance across different games played.
        </li>
        <li class="mb-2">
          <strong>Positional Context:</strong> We also compare players within
          their position (e.g., QB, RB, WR, TE) to better understand their rank
          movements.
